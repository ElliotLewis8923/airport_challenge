# When we land a plane at the airport, the plane in question should have its status changed to "landed"
#
# When the plane takes of from the airport, the plane's status should become "flying"

# grand final
# Given 6 planes, each plane must land. When the airport is full, every plane must take off again.
# Be careful of the weather, it could be stormy!
# Check when all the planes have landed that they have the right status "landed"
# Once all the planes are in the air again, check that they have the status of flying!
